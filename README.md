# Credit Worth Evaluation ML Modelling

Intended for this project, is to evaluate the credit worth of customers based on their data.
This model will help money lenders determine if their clients are worth of a credit loans.

## Models

The data is fitted on a Support Vector Machine and an Artificial Neural Network.

## Performannce

Both models score a moderate score.

## Optimization

Further optimization to be done to improve model accuracy

## Further Modelling

Alternative ML models to be built to be used to determine if there can be a better score.
